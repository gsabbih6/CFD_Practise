# Computational Fluid Dynamics at University of Tennesse at Chattanooga

This repositotory is a compilation of the application of several algorithms that 
are used the solution of Partial Differential equations as taught during the semester. 
##Finite Difference methods for solving PDEs
The implementation is fount the the FiniteDifference.cpp file which contains an application of the FTCS, FTBS and Lax 
methods.
